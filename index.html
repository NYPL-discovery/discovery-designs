    <h1>Discovery Designs</h1>

    <p>This is where <strong>rough designs</strong> of the <strong>new research discovery system</strong> will be published. It will generally be displayed as static HTML files with very light interaction (if any.) Each design will have an associated Google Document which will contain notes and various design decisions represented in that particular design.</p>

    <h2>Feedback</h2>

    <p>Your feedback is critical to the design process. Initially we will have one primary way of receiving feedback:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Each design will have a Google Document associated with it which will contain a list of design components and descriptions</li>
      <li><strong>Visit a document</strong> and make sure you are signed in using your @nypl.org account</li>
      <li><strong>Add a comment</strong> to any part of the document that is relevant to your feedback. This will allow us to discuss the issue with you and possibly resolve it</li>
      <li>If you can't find a relevant item in the document to add a comment to, please add your issue to the bottom of the document and include your email address or add a comment to it so I can respond to you.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Email <a href="mailto:brianfoo@nypl.org">brianfoo@nypl.org</a> or Slack <strong>@beefoo</strong> in <strong>#discovery</strong> for any other questions or feedback that does not fit into the above process.</p>
